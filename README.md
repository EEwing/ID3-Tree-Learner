# ID3-Tree-Learner

This project learns a decision tree located in the training csv files. It contains a custom CSV reader, based on C++ standard library calls.

Given an adequate training set, this algorithm can predict, with high likelyhood, the outcome of an arbitrary decision path. It uses the ID3 algorithm for optimal performance.
